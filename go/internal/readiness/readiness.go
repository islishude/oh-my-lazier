	// against new snapshots, so one stuck behind a wedged lane or fee cap lets
	// the on-chain price age toward the staleness cutoff. Config validation
	// guarantees the schedule leaves at least a 600-second margin
	// (MinPricingFreshnessMarginSeconds) between the worst healthy write
	// evaluation and snapshot expiry; escalating at half that margin keeps a

	// few defer cycles when it can outbid the active attempt; a cancel this
	// old is stalled — typically the mandatory bump exceeds the configured
	// fee cap, deferring every attempt — and needs the operator (a cap fix,
	// then the cancel proceeds automatically).
