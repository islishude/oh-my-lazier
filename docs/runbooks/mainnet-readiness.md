# Mainnet Readiness Runbook

This runbook is the final review index before any mainnet deployment proposal. Phase 1 remains EVM-only and must not use self-only DVN.

## Required Inputs

- Validated worker config for the target environment.
- `configdiff` output from the last approved config to the proposed config.
- `configcheck` output proving the proposed worker config matches live chain state.
- LayerZero address refresh output from `npm run check:lz-addresses`.
- DB-backed readiness output from `go run ./go/cmd/readinesscheck -config <worker.yaml> -format json`.
- `inspect:lz-config` output for every configured direction.
- Signer inventory and key-management review.
- Price bot runbook evidence for the latest OpenPriceFeed shared price snapshot update and worker fee-model check.
- Rate-limit and pause review for every OFT pathway.
- Monitoring dashboard and alert proof.
- Runbook review output from `npm run check:runbooks`.
- Security review report with no open critical findings.

## Non-Negotiable Phase 1 Scope

- Ethereum Sepolia <-> Hoodi rehearsal must complete before mainnet.
- No `composeMsg`.
- No `lzCompose`.
- No native drop.
- No ordered execution.
- No non-EVM chain support.
- Worker chain configs must declare `family: evm`.
- No self-only DVN.
- Required DVNs must include OpenDVN and at least one independent external DVN.
  LayerZero Labs DVN is an optional external DVN choice, not a required
  provider; deployment profiles can opt into repo-known metadata with
  `chains[].includeLayerZeroLabsDVN` when it exists for the local chain.
- Confirmations must be explicitly configured per chain and match the approved LayerZero ULN configuration.

## Review Sequence

1. Run `make check`.
2. Run `go run ./go/cmd/configdiff -from <approved.yaml> -to <proposed.yaml>`.
3. Run `go run ./go/cmd/configcheck -config <proposed.yaml> -format json`.
4. Run `npm run inspect:lz-config` for each configured direction and archive output.
5. Complete `docs/runbooks/key-management.md`.
6. Complete `docs/runbooks/price-bot.md`.
7. Complete `docs/runbooks/rate-limit.md`.
8. Confirm `docs/runbooks/monitoring.md` dashboard and alerts are active.
9. Run `npm run check:runbooks` and archive output.
10. Run `go run ./go/cmd/readinesscheck -config <worker.yaml> -format json` and archive output.
11. Complete security review and resolve all critical findings.
12. Confirm rollback steps for Executor and DVN config are documented with previous config values.
13. Confirm canary transfer amount, sender account, recipient account, minimum recipient balance, signer, owner, and operator contacts.
14. Run `npm run check:migration-evidence -- --migration-evidence <record.json>`.
15. Approve the migration ticket only after every artifact above is attached.

## Go / Worker Checks

Required commands:

```bash
go test ./...
go test ./go/internal/signer/keystore ./go/internal/signer/kms -count=1
go test ./go/internal/config ./go/internal/configdiff ./go/cmd/configdiff -count=1
go test ./go/internal/configcheck ./go/cmd/configcheck -count=1
go test ./go/internal/metrics ./go/internal/db ./go/internal/app -count=1
go test ./go/internal/readiness ./go/cmd/readinesscheck -count=1
npm run check:runbooks
make security-check
```

Required runtime checks:

- `/healthz` returns `200`.
- `/readyz` returns `200`.
- `/metrics` exposes chain pause, pathway pause, packet, executor, DVN, tx outbox, signer native balance, indexer cursor, and indexer polling metrics.
- No chain or pathway is paused before the migration begins.
- No active-chain tx outbox row is stuck in `failed` with `retry_state="exhausted"`.
- Every active transaction signer reports `laz_signer_native_balance_wei >= laz_signer_min_native_balance_wei`.
- For deployments with `services.dvn.enabled: true`, no DVN job is stuck in `READY_TO_VERIFY` or `VERIFY_TX_ENQUEUED` beyond the expected tx manager polling and confirmation window.
- For deployments with `services.executor.enabled: true`, no executor job is stuck in `WAITING_DVN_VERIFICATION`, `VERIFIABLE`, `COMMIT_TX_ENQUEUED`, `COMMITTED`, `EXECUTABLE`, or `LZ_RECEIVE_TX_ENQUEUED` beyond the expected source/destination confirmation window.
- Every enabled pathway has advanced indexer cursors for the roles enabled in that process: executor requires `executor_source` and `executor_destination`; DVN requires `dvn_source` and `dvn_destination`.
- `go run ./go/cmd/readinesscheck -config <worker.yaml>` exits successfully.

## Contract / LayerZero Checks

Required commands:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npx hardhat test solidity
npm run inspect:lz-config
```

Required state:

- OFT peers are configured in both directions.
- OpenExecutor and OpenDVN allow only intended SendLib addresses.
- Worker pathway config is enabled only for approved OApps.
- Endpoint executor config points to each pathway's configured `source_workers.open_executor` only after the executor migration step.
- Source SendUln config includes each pathway's configured `source_workers.open_dvn` plus the approved independent external DVN only during the DVN join step.
- Destination ReceiveUln config includes each pathway's configured `destination_workers.open_dvn` plus the same approved independent external DVN only during the DVN join step.
- Destination OpenDVN authorizes the active destination `tx_roles.dvn` signer before active DVN mode is enabled.
- Optional DVNs are explicitly disabled for the first-phase required-DVN migration.
- Source OpenPriceFeed `priceSnapshot(dstEid)` is fresh, the pricing signer is an authorized PriceFeed submitter, OpenExecutor/OpenDVN `priceFeed()` both point to the configured feed, and each worker's `feeModel(dstEid)` matches the approved price evidence. Same-native pathways document the 1:1 route; cross-asset pathways document the selected primary, explicit freshness limit, optional sanity set, and deviation threshold. Chainlink and Uniswap are required only when explicitly referenced, and Uniswap may only be sanity.

## Rollback Approval

The rollback section of the migration ticket must include:

- previous Executor config
- previous send ULN config
- previous receive ULN config
- `npm run configure:lz-rollback -- --dry-run` output showing the exact rollback `setConfig` batches
- restored Executor/ULN config check after rollback
- canary transfer evidence after rollback
- owner account able to pause/unpause the affected OApp/OFT pathway
- signer account able to submit worker transactions
- `go run ./go/cmd/draincheck -config <worker.yaml> -src-eid <src> -dst-eid <dst> -format json` output for the affected pathway
- manual retry plan for verified but undelivered packets when `verified_but_undelivered_count` is non-zero, using txmgr automatic retry and `tx_manager.stale_broadcast_replacement_after_seconds` pending replacement first. Run `go run ./go/cmd/txretry -config <worker.yaml> -action retry-failed|replace -id <tx_outbox_id>` only after automatic retry is exhausted or an operator override is approved. `replace` keeps the nonce, re-reads the latest RPC header/gas suggestions, and signs only when the current fee is at least 10% above the previous signed fee without exceeding the configured cap. `retry-failed` requeues sign, broadcast, and estimate-gas failures in place so an assigned nonce is preserved; only receipt-failed rows are cloned to keep mined failure evidence, and lzReceive receipt retries are skipped when the executor workflow has already advanced.

## Rejection Criteria

Reject mainnet readiness if:

- any critical security finding remains open
- self-only DVN is proposed
- required DVNs do not include an independent external DVN
- confirmations are missing, zero, or do not match the approved LayerZero ULN configuration
- signer inventory or rollback signer is missing
- price snapshot evidence is missing, stale, or not produced through the approved pricing path
- rate-limit capacity/refill is not documented per pathway
- monitoring alerts are not active
- `make security-check` fails
- config diff output is missing or unreviewed
- canary amount, sender, recipient, receipt, or recipient balance evidence is missing
- `npm run check:migration-evidence` fails for the migration ticket record
- `go run ./go/cmd/readinesscheck -config <worker.yaml>` reports any issue
