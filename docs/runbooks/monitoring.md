# Monitoring Checklist

The first-phase worker exposes HTTP health and Prometheus text metrics from `metrics.listen_address`.

Endpoints:

- `/healthz`: process liveness only. It returns `200` without touching Postgres.
- `/readyz`: readiness check. It returns `200` only when the worker can read the DB stats snapshot and the DB-backed readiness rules pass.
- `/metrics`: Prometheus text metrics derived from durable Postgres state plus process-local indexer polling and worker-loop retry status.

Required scrape target:

```text
http://<worker-host>:9090/metrics
```

Required alert rules are tracked in `docs/monitoring/prometheus-alerts.yml`.
`npm run check:runbooks` verifies that the documented high-signal alerts remain
present and linked back to this runbook.

Required alerts:

- `LazWorkerReadinessFailed`: `/readyz` returns non-200 for more than two scrape intervals; page.
- `LazChainPaused`: `laz_chain_paused == 1` for any chain; page immediately. This means chain-wide quorum safety logic paused the worker path.
- `LazPathwayPaused`: `laz_pathway_paused == 1` for any pathway; page immediately. This means packet-level receipt/log conflict safety logic paused a pathway.
- `LazDVNQuorumConflict`: `laz_dvn_jobs_total{status="QUORUM_CONFLICT"} > 0`; page immediately and inspect source RPC providers before unpausing.
- `LazDVNReorgDetected`: `laz_dvn_jobs_total{status="REORG_DETECTED"} > 0`; page if it persists past the next confirmation loop; inspect source RPC providers and source transaction receipts.
- `LazPacketManualReview`: `laz_packets_total{status="MANUAL_REVIEW"} > 0`; ticket within one business day; page if count increases during migration.
- `LazExecutorReceiveFailed`: `laz_executor_jobs_total{status="LZ_RECEIVE_FAILED"} > 0`; ticket and inspect destination `LzReceiveAlert` logs. A failed outbox receipt may be automatically cloned for retry and restore the job to `LZ_RECEIVE_TX_ENQUEUED`; persistent `LZ_RECEIVE_FAILED` means the retry path has not yet cleared the workflow state.
- `LazWorkerManualReview`: `laz_executor_jobs_total{status="MANUAL_REVIEW"} > 0` or `laz_dvn_jobs_total{status="MANUAL_REVIEW"} > 0`; ticket and block migration approval until reviewed.
- `LazTxOutboxFailed`: `laz_tx_outbox_total{status="failed",retry_state="exhausted"} > 0`; ticket; page if exhausted failure count increases for active migration chains. Rows with `retry_state="retrying"` are still under txmgr automatic retry, and rows with `retry_state="superseded"` either already have a retry child or the workflow advanced past the stale failure.
- `LazWorkerFeeNegativeMargin`: `laz_worker_fee_negative_margin_jobs > 0`; page after five minutes. This means mined worker transaction gas cost, converted to source-chain native wei, exceeds the source-chain assignment fee for at least one job.
- `LazWorkerFeeReconciliationPending`: `laz_worker_fee_unpriced_receipts > 0`; ticket after fifteen minutes. Check pricing source health and `fee_accounting` loop logs; tx receipt status has already been recorded and is not blocked by pricing failures.
- `LazSignerLowNativeBalance`: `laz_signer_native_balance_wei < laz_signer_min_native_balance_wei`; page after five minutes. Fund the affected worker signer before queued or replacement transactions exhaust their configured fee caps.
- `LazIndexerPollFailing`: `laz_indexer_poll_success == 0` with a non-zero `laz_indexer_failure_since_timestamp_seconds`; page only after the failure sequence outlasts the configured poll interval and persists for another five minutes. A successful retry clears the failure sequence before it pages.
- `LazIndexerPollStalled`: compare `laz_indexer_last_poll_timestamp_seconds`, or `laz_indexer_start_timestamp_seconds` before the first completion, with twice `laz_indexer_poll_interval_seconds`; page after the condition persists for five minutes. This catches an initial or later poll that stops completing without treating regularly completed failed polls as a stall.

Active worker status paths:

- DVN active verification: `ASSIGNED -> WAITING_CONFIRMATIONS -> QUORUM_CHECKING -> READY_TO_VERIFY -> VERIFY_TX_ENQUEUED -> VERIFIED`.
- Executor delivery: `ASSIGNED -> WAITING_DVN_VERIFICATION -> VERIFIABLE -> COMMIT_TX_ENQUEUED -> COMMITTED -> EXECUTABLE -> LZ_RECEIVE_TX_ENQUEUED -> DELIVERED`.
- Shadow DVN verification stops at `WOULD_VERIFY`; it must not enqueue `dvn_verify` transactions.
- Destination-chain reconciliation can skip transaction enqueue and move jobs forward when matching on-chain completion is already observable. During database rebuild or historical replay, `PacketVerified`, `PacketDelivered`, `LzReceiveAlert`, and `PayloadVerified` events can fill the corresponding executor or DVN status and tx hash even when the local outbox row no longer exists.
- Destination cursors keep enabled-pathway events pending while the local source packet is absent. They advance past missing source packets only when the source indexer recorded a skipped-assignment tombstone, such as a disabled pathway, unexpected source worker, or a packet sent through a different send library. Source indexing filters the raw PacketV1 route against configured pathways before strict packet decoding, so unrelated OApps sharing the same send library cannot block a source stream.
- `QUORUM_CONFLICT`, `REORG_DETECTED`, `MANUAL_REVIEW`, persistent `LZ_RECEIVE_FAILED`, and `tx_outbox.status="failed"` with `retry_state="exhausted"` are operator-action states, not healthy terminal states.

Before any migration approval, run the DB-backed readiness gate and attach the JSON output:

```bash
go run ./go/cmd/readinesscheck -config <worker.yaml> -format json
```

The readiness gate fails if an enabled chain is paused, an enabled pathway between enabled chains is paused, an active chain has exhausted failed `tx_outbox` rows, a packet/job for an enabled service is in a manual-review or failed/conflict/reorg state, or an enabled pathway's required role-specific indexer cursor is missing or has not advanced past block `0`. Executor-enabled processes require `executor_source` on the source chain and `executor_destination` on the destination chain. DVN-enabled processes require `dvn_source` on the source chain and `dvn_destination` on the destination chain.

Migration dashboard panels:

- Chain enabled/paused status by `eid` and `name`.
- Pathway paused status by `src_eid` and `dst_eid`.
- Packet count by pathway and status.
- Executor job count by status.
- DVN job count by status.
- Tx outbox count by chain, status, and retry state.
- Mined receipt gas cost by chain and purpose: `laz_tx_receipt_gas_cost_dst_wei`.
- Worker fee revenue, actual gas cost, gross margin, negative-margin jobs, and unpriced receipts by role and pathway: `laz_worker_fee_revenue_src_wei`, `laz_worker_fee_actual_gas_cost_src_wei`, `laz_worker_fee_gross_margin_src_wei`, `laz_worker_fee_negative_margin_jobs`, and `laz_worker_fee_unpriced_receipts`.
- Signer native balance, configured minimum native balance, balance poll success, last success timestamp, and last error timestamp by chain and signer.
- Indexer cursor last block by chain and stream in `laz_indexer_cursor_last_block`: `executor_source`, `executor_destination`, `dvn_source`, and `dvn_destination`.
- Indexer configured poll interval, loop start timestamp, poll success, current failure start, last completed poll, last success, last poll duration, observed head, confirmed block upper bound, and last error timestamp by chain: `laz_indexer_poll_interval_seconds`, `laz_indexer_start_timestamp_seconds`, `laz_indexer_poll_success`, `laz_indexer_failure_since_timestamp_seconds`, `laz_indexer_last_poll_timestamp_seconds`, `laz_indexer_last_success_timestamp_seconds`, `laz_indexer_last_poll_duration_seconds`, `laz_indexer_observed_head_block`, `laz_indexer_confirmed_to_block`, and `laz_indexer_last_error_timestamp_seconds`.
- Worker loop retry count and last retry timestamp by loop name.

Operational assumptions:

- Packet, job, outbox, receipt gas-cost, worker fee, pause, and cursor metrics are derived from committed DB state, so a worker restart should not reset that visibility. Indexer poll status, signer balance status, and worker loop retry metrics are process-local and reset on restart.
- Worker binaries default to `-log-level info`. Run with `-log-level debug` during investigations to include normal skip/defer reasons without changing durable state.
- The worker defaults to `-indexer-progress-log-interval 1m`. Set it to `0` to disable periodic indexer progress `Info` logs; per-poll details remain available with `-log-level debug`, and continuous progress should be monitored through `/metrics`.
- Worker logs emit `Info` entries for durable state changes and transaction enqueue/broadcast/receipt milestones, `Warn` entries for conflict, reorg, receipt failure, signing failure, and broadcast failure paths, and `Debug` entries for normal skip/defer reasons that do not change state.
- Indexer logs emit at most one throttled `Info` `indexer progress` entry per chain per interval, aggregating advanced streams, block range, lag, processed item counts, and duration. Per-stream `indexer stream advanced` entries and per-poll `indexer poll completed` summaries are `Debug`. Per-event entries identify source assignments and destination reconciliation events by `guid`, `src_eid`, `dst_eid`, and `tx_hash`.
- Tx manager logs identify nonce bootstrap/claim, signing, broadcast, receipt confirmation/failure, mined gas usage, actual destination-chain gas cost, and retry enqueue by `tx_outbox_id` or `id`, `chain_eid`, `signer`, and `purpose`; they must not include calldata, signatures, keystore contents, or raw secret-bearing config.
- RPC failures and quorum conflicts identify configured endpoints only as `provider[n]`, where `n` is the zero-based configuration order. Logs and persisted job errors must not include complete RPC URLs or their credentials, paths, or query values.
- Pricing logs identify `eid`, source name, primary/sanity role, and failure category. Deviation rejections also include `deviation_bps`. They must not include market-data base URLs, RPC URLs, API keys, or secret-bearing configuration. An unhealthy primary, no healthy declared sanity source, or any healthy sanity deviation stops the whole price-update cycle before enqueue; there is no sanity fallback.
- The `fee_accounting` loop converts mined worker receipt gas costs to source-chain native wei. Pricing-source errors leave affected receipts pending and visible through `laz_worker_fee_unpriced_receipts`; they do not revert tx receipt confirmation or job state transitions.
- `services.executor.enabled` and `services.dvn.enabled` are process-level switches. A deployment that runs only one role should page on that role's streams and job states, while the other role's durable cursors may be absent in that process.
- Txmgr automatically retries failed outbox rows with classified failure kinds for up to five attempts. It also automatically replaces broadcast rows that have no receipt after `tx_manager.stale_broadcast_replacement_after_seconds` seconds, keeping the nonce and using the existing replacement fee bump while still respecting configured fee caps. `txretry` remains the manual override for exhausted rows or operator-reviewed replacement, but it is no longer the default path for ordinary failed rows or ordinary pending replacements.
- If Postgres-backed stats are temporarily unavailable, `/metrics` still exposes process-local indexer and worker loop retry metrics and sets `laz_metrics_db_snapshot_available 0`; `/readyz` remains unavailable until the DB-backed readiness snapshot succeeds.
- `/healthz` is only a liveness probe. Use `/readyz` and `/metrics` for operational readiness and alerting.
- Do not unpause a chain or pathway until the conflict source is identified and the latest `inspect:lz-config` output still matches the intended migration config.
- A deterministic active-DVN destination config mismatch moves the affected job to `MANUAL_REVIEW` and pauses that pathway atomically. Other pathways continue processing; clear the drift and review the recorded `last_error` before unpausing.
- A deterministic executor delivery build failure, including unsupported persisted executor options observed after a permissionless commit, moves the job and packet to `MANUAL_REVIEW` with `last_error` instead of retrying indefinitely.
